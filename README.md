DEF Cash
===========
DEF Cash is an experiment in on-chain scaling. It's a code fork of Bitcoin ABC, but it will create a new blockchain 
with different economic parameters. DEF Cash will adopt features that are suitable for a peer-to-peer electronic 
cash system, but too different from the Bitcoin tradition to be applied in Bitcoin Cash:
+ A dynamic blocksize as in Monero
+ A faster blocktime
+ A more constant coin issuance schedule
+ An ASIC-resistant proof of work algorithm, or multiple algorithms (maybe supported with proof-of-proof)
+ Maybe a [dynamic blocktime](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79837.0) if that's possible, but I'm just making this up while I'm writing this down
+ Maybe some features from the [Bitcoin Hardfork Wishlist](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardfork_Wishlist#Major_structural_changes) if someone wants to implement them

DEF Cash also the developer's first C++ project.


What is Bitcoin Cash?
---------------------

[Bitcoin Cash](https://www.bitcoincash.org/) is an experimental digital
currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It
uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing
transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.
Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin. It became a separate currency from
the version supported by Bitcoin Core when the two split on August 1, 2017.
Bitcoin Cash and the Bitcoin Core version of Bitcoin share the same
transaction history up until the split.

What is Bitcoin ABC?
--------------------

[Bitcoin ABC](https://www.bitcoinabc.org) is the name of open-source software which enables the use of
Bitcoin Cash. It is a fork of the [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org)
software project. The goal of Bitcoin ABC is to create sound money that is usable by everyone in
the world. We believe this is a civilization-changing technology which will
dramatically increase human flourishing, freedom, and prosperity. The project
aims to achieve this goal by implementing a series of optimizations and
protocol upgrades that will enable peer-to-peer digital cash to scale many
orders of magnitude beyond current limits.
